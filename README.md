# SMART-DUSTBIN
# Hackathon project '19

An arduino based smart dustbin.

BASED ON:

Arduino Uno x2
IR sensor
Ultrasonic sensor
L298n motor driver
Motors along with wheels
Power supply
Connecting Wires
Microphones with built in amplifiers x4


The following project was made as part of a college hackathon (Hackathon V15).It uses basic logic to run the program. The arduino controlled device uses sound sensors to detect a given source of sound and move towards it. On reaching the required destination, it detects the source with the help of the Ultrasonic sensor and comes to a hault.
The motors are connected to l298n Motor drivers and are programmed the same. 
The following project can be used in offices and homes where a simple source of sound, like a clap will initialize the dustbin to move towards it.

Another arduino uno is added to the upper part of the Dustbin to control the lid. An IR sensor is placed just above the lid to detect any substances above the dustbin. On sensing, it will open the lid and close automatically.
